**Tag**
----

Tags are tags :)) </br>
All posts (currently Song and poem) could have multiple tags that 
are describe in their own documentation.

* **Structure**

    * Tags only have name that has no space within and starts with #.
    Don't worry server will handle these condition, any string 
    that you give will be transformed by server.
        </br>
        * sample
            `{"name": "#new_tag}`
        
    * Unlike other parameters that could pass in `POST` method to create 
        an object that they MUST already exist in data base, you can pass 
        any new tags you want; we will handle it :Like-a-boss :))
